I am a PhD Student at the [Computer Vision Center](https://www.cvc.uab.es), Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona working with [Dr. Joost van de Weijer](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Gsw2iUEAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Bartlomiej Twardowski](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8yywECgAAAAJ&hl=en) at the [Learning and Machine Perception](http://lamp.cvc.uab.es) group. Previously, I graduated with a B.E. in Computer Science and M.Sc. in Mathematics from [Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/) India in 2022. I was also a research assistant at the [Augmented Vision Group](https://www.dfki.de/web/forschung/forschungsbereiche/erweiterte-realitaet) at [DFKI](https://www.dfki.de/web) in  Kaiserslautern, Germany.

Most of the research works in my PhD is in Continual Learning. I did some works on Federated Learning and Information Retrieval as well.
Recently, I am also exploring Vision-Language Models and Generative AI with Diffusion Models. 

Currently, I am doing an internship at [Sony AI](https://ai.sony) in Barcelona where I am exploring training data attribution methods for Diffusion Models with [Joan Serra](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=sZLj96sAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). Prior to this, I was doing a research stay in KU Leuven [PSI group](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/psi) where I was studying modality gap in Vision-Language Models with [Tinne Tuytelaars](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=EuFF9kUAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and [Gido van de Ven](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3k0l15MAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).

I serve as reviewer for several conferences (ICML, ICLR, AISTATS, NeurIPS, CoLLAs, CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, WACV, BMVC) and journals (IEEE TPAMI, IJCV, TMLR, IEEE TNNLS, IEEE TIP). I have also been recognized as one of the outstanding/top reviewers in BMVC 2024 and NeurIPS 2024.
