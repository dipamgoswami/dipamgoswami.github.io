I am a PhD Student at the [Computer Vision Center](https://www.cvc.uab.es), Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona working with [Dr. Joost van de Weijer](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Gsw2iUEAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Bartlomiej Twardowski](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8yywECgAAAAJ&hl=en) at the [Learning and Machine Perception](http://lamp.cvc.uab.es) group. Previously, I graduated with a B.E. in Computer Science and M.Sc. in Mathematics from [Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/) India in 2022.

I am mostly working on Continual Learning problems. Recently, I am also exploring Federated Learning, Document Retrieval and Large Language Models. I have published research papers on Continual Learning for Image Classification, Few-Shot Continual Learning, Incremental Object Detection and Semantic Segmentation.
