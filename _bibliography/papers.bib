  abstract={Continual learning methods are known to suffer from catastrophic forgetting, a phenomenon that is particularly hard to counter for methods that do not store exemplars of previous tasks. Therefore, to reduce potential drift in the feature extractor, existing exemplar-free methods are typ- ically evaluated in settings where the first task is signif- icantly larger than subsequent tasks. Their performance drops drastically in more challenging settings starting with a smaller first task. To address this problem of feature drift estimation for exemplar-free methods, we propose to adver- sarially perturb the current samples such that their embed- dings are close to the old class prototypes in the old model embedding space. We then estimate the drift in the embed- ding space from the old to the new model using the per- turbed images and compensate the prototypes accordingly. We exploit the fact that adversarial samples are transferable from the old to the new feature space in a continual learning setting. The generation of these images is simple and com- putationally cheap. We demonstrate in our experiments that the proposed approach better tracks the movement of proto- types in embedding space and outperforms existing meth- ods on several standard continual learning benchmarks as well as on fine-grained datasets.},
